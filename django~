Django circular model reference

as you can see in the docs, for exactly this reason it is possible to specify the foreign model as a string.
team = models.ForeignKey('Team')

------
After a server reboot after a crash (after an OVH intervention):
"could not connect to server: Connection refused
	Is the server running on host 'localhost' (127.0.0.1) and accepting
	TCP/IP connections on port 5432?"

watch in the logs:
	sudo tail -f -n 200 /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.4-main.log
if it says "could not create lock file "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432.lock": Permission denied",
then check the owner of /var/run/postgresql:
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /var/run/postgresql

restart the service:
sudo service postgresql restart

wait until the logs says : "database system is ready to accept connections
"

------
Hazardous operations on Models that will cause bugs when applying migrations:
- transforming a parent class into an abstract parent class

------
'SafeText' object has no attribute 'status_code'

the called view doesn't return a 'render()' or a 'HttpResponse()', (maybe it returns a loader.render_to_string(), which is not good. Should return a 'HttpResponse(loader.render_to_string())' )
